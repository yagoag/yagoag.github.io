		<br />
		<p>I’m Yago. Welcome to my website!</p>
		<p>I am a Brazilian, nineteen-year-old Computer Science student and I have created this page with the intent of showing and organizing my projects and projects I am involved with.</p>
		<p>I am currently in love with web development, which is what most of my projects are related to. Most of the projects are on GitHub, so there'll also be a link to their page on GitHub in case you want to dive into their code.</p>

			<p>RePepeca is a bill management system based in PHP and MySQL for people dividing houses and bills, especially university students. It is meant to be used by "Repúblicas" - often shorted down to "Rep(s)" - which are houses divided by university students in Brazil, usually in a large number of people. It can also be applied to many other situation in which people share bills and/or borrow money to each other.</p>
            <p>The idea for the system started when my República needed a way to properly and easily split the bills and control their payment, after we had problems with having to update everyone's balances when we needed to split a bill, which often caused error due to miscalculations. The system is transaction-based and has two main types of transactions: bills and payments, which can represent many other types of transactions, such as money borrowing and bill payment.</p>

			<p>Pluto is a project I’ve created with my friend Leonardo (<a href="http://github.com/Leonardobl">Leonardobl</a>) as a project for one of our classes. At the moment the professor said that we could do anything, we started brainstorming possible projects and after starting many of them and abandoning them, we came up with this last-week project which came out to be pretty cool: Leonardo was working with a kanban board to manage some projects and had the idea to create a website in which you would be able to create a virtual kanban for each of your projects. In Pluto you have a username and a password which allows you to log into your account in which you’ll have your project groups, each one with their respective projects with, again, a kanban for each of those.</p>
			<p>The project has been done using PHP alongside, of course, the omnipresent HTML &amp; CSS.</p>

			<p>Calculadora IRA is a website I’ve created so that people could calculate their Index of Academic Yield (in Portuguese, Índice de Rendimento Acadêmico, or IRA as most people call it) in my University.<p>
			<p>In the beginning it was just a simple project, which had been completed in just two days of HTML, CSS and JS scripting, but the students turned out to really like it and some sugested that I made an app for the calculator so you could always have it right there at their phones.</p>
			<p>I’m currently working on a way to save your scores into the calculator on the website and soon I’ll probably start developing the app for it.</p>

			<p>This project is actually a prototype for an undergraduate research project that I developed at the Laboratory of Advanced Interaction (LIA) in my university, together with George (<a href="http://github.com/brucemacho">brucemacho</a>). It aimed the modelling and implementation of an application for tablets with Android to simulate basketball tactical boards, which are adopted by many coaches of the sport, with special emphasys on the human-computer interaction, whereas we follow the Third Paradigm of HCI.</p>
			<p>The prototype is divided in two versions - a simple and a complete one, - both of them developed in Java.</p>
